WP3 Repository for SysML modelling of the SRS

=============================================

* This repository is part of WP3.
* Owner: Pierre-Francois Jauquet (Alstom)

=============================================

In our Braunschweig workshop on WP3 activities we agreed to concentrate activities for getting SysML modelling started in this repository.
The repository is by purpose private for the time being.
* It must not be made public without explicit permission of the active committers.
* The Activity is closely related to the [SSRS](https://github.com/openETCS/SSRS) activities.
* We will definitly need the material collected in the SSRS [wiki](https://github.com/openETCS/SSRS/wiki).
